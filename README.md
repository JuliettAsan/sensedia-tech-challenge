## Notes

==US1 display the city:== a constant of type array was created with 20 cities and one is randomly selected for each user.

==USX Post and albums counters:== in the table, posts/albums are showed as a number, this value is calculated counting the posts/albums a user has associated using the corresponding endpoints.

==USX the blocked property:== since a user doesn't have the property 'blocked' and this new property can't be added by using PUT, this was resolved by appending the string '|blocked' to the property 'name'. So when a user is blocked it is removed from the list because the list is filtering the users without the blocked string to be displayed in the table.

==USX Register:== the fields "Nombre completo", "Ciudad", "DÃ­as de la semana" of the registration form are not being used in the actual POST call since these properties don't exist in the schema and new properties can't be added to it.

==US3 /user/{username}:== Considered this route as a user detail view for each user of the table, since the username can't be unique, the actual route is user/{id} where the user id is unique.

==US5 dropdown menu:== a json file was created with user data to be used in the menu for the user initial and name.
